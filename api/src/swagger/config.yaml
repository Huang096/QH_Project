  description: "Metabolite Atlas can be accessed programmatically using this web API. Here we provide endpoints to get global information on the list of models integrated in Metabolic Atlas and to retrieve bulk or details information on those models. The API is still under developpment and might change without notice.\n\nUse model.short_name attribute (e.g. \"Yeast-GEM\", \"Human-GEM\") or model.database attribute as model parameter."
